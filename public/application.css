/**
 * This is a MANIFEST file. This is the first css file
 * processed, so any rule here will be on the top of the bundle.
 *
 * @import rules will look into node_modules
 *
 * All .css files that are not preceeded with an underscore
 * will be automatically bundled.
 *
 * Example auto bundled files:
 * app/assets/styles/my-component.css
 * app/views/feature/feature.css
 *
 * Files which will not be auto bundled, but can be imported
 * app/assets/_component.css
 * app/views/features/_feature-part.css
